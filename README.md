gdocs_importer
==============

Google Docs Importer is part of a tutorial I wrote on my old blog, [which you can start reading here.](http://www.andymboyle.com/2013/06/30/importing-data-from-google-docs-into-django-step-one-postgres-and-your-local-virtualenvironment/)

You'll need to create a local_settings.py file in the gdocs_importer directory. 

Then put something like: 'SECRET_KEY = "asecretkeygoeshere"' into that file.
